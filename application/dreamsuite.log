INFO|2017-01-27 00:18:00,766|export_import.story_io[123-import_story_row]>> On December 22, 2016 Tiny Hands Nepal staff at Chandrauta intercepted a 15 year old girl named Rita who was traveling with one other person who appeared to be a victim. Border and transit monitoring staff are trained to observe people's manner, appearance and actions for clues that something may be wrong. In this case the attention of our staff was initially drawn to Rita because she looked young. Because our staff are familiar with the local culture and norms they are able to notice when someone's appearance seems suspicious or out of place.

When she was questioned by our border staff Rita said that she was on her way to India for medical treatment. In the end the staff person making the interception reported that they felt very sure that it was a trafficking case. It isn't always possible to be so certain, but in this case they were fortunate to uncover a great deal of evidence. 

Rita returned home before a full interview could be completed with her, but a staff person from our Kathmandu office will follow up with her by phone in about one month to see how she is doing. Rita was intercepted as a result of your support. We believe that human trafficking - what may have happened to Rita without your help - is the greatest injustice in the world. Thank you for your support in helping to prevent Rita from being trafficked.

INFO|2017-01-27 00:18:01,578|export_import.story_io[123-import_story_row]>> On December 22, 2016 Tiny Hands Nepal staff at Chandrauta intercepted a 10 year old girl named Pabitra who was traveling with one other person who appeared to be a victim. Border and transit monitoring staff are trained to observe people's manner, appearance and actions for clues that something may be wrong. In this case the attention of our staff was initially drawn to Pabitra because she looked young. Because our staff are familiar with the local culture and norms they are able to notice when someone's appearance seems suspicious or out of place.

When she was questioned by our border staff Pabitra said that she was on her way to India for medical treatment. In the end the staff person making the interception reported that they felt very sure that it was a trafficking case. It isn't always possible to be so certain, but in this case they were fortunate to uncover a great deal of evidence. 

Pabitra returned home before a full interview could be completed with her, but a staff person from our Kathmandu office will follow up with her by phone in about one month to see how she is doing. Pabitra was intercepted as a result of your support. We believe that human trafficking - what may have happened to Pabitra without your help - is the greatest injustice in the world. Thank you for your support in helping to prevent Pabitra from being trafficked.

INFO|2017-01-27 00:19:29,454|export_import.story_io[123-import_story_row]>> On December 21, 2016 Tiny Hands Nepal staff at Chandrauta intercepted a 22 year old woman named Anita who was traveling with 2 other people, one of which appeared to be a victim and one of which appeared to be a trafficker. Border and transit monitoring staff are trained to observe people's manner, appearance and actions for clues that something may be wrong. In this case the attention of our staff was initially drawn to Anita because she was wearing village clothes. A person's attire and the things they are carrying with them can provide telltale hints about them and where they are from.

When she was questioned by our border staff Anita said that she was on her way to India in order to visit family. Upon further investigation our staff recognized several red flags, including that although Anita claimed to just be going for shopping she had things for an overnight stay in her bags. Traffickers will often tell their victims to lie if questioned, but our staff are trained to catch any small inconsistencies in their story. In the end the staff person making the interception reported that they felt somewhat sure that it was a trafficking case. Because traffickers try their best to make things look normal it isn't always possible to know for certain that trafficking is taking place. 

Anita returned home before a full interview could be completed with her, but a staff person from our Kathmandu office will follow up with her by phone in about one month to see how she is doing. Anita was intercepted as a result of your support. We believe that human trafficking - what may have happened to Anita without your help - is the greatest injustice in the world. Thank you for your support in helping to prevent Anita from being trafficked.

INFO|2017-01-27 00:19:30,669|export_import.story_io[123-import_story_row]>> On December 21, 2016 Tiny Hands Nepal staff at Chandrauta intercepted a 16 year old boy named Suraj who was traveling with 2 other people, one of which appeared to be a victim and one of which appeared to be a trafficker. Border and transit monitoring staff are trained to observe people's manner, appearance and actions for clues that something may be wrong. In this case the attention of our staff was initially drawn to Suraj because he was wearing village clothes. A person's attire and the things they are carrying with them can provide telltale hints about them and where they are from.

When he was questioned by our border staff Suraj said that he was on his way to India in order to visit family. Upon further investigation our staff recognized several red flags, including that although Suraj claimed to just be going for shopping he had things for an overnight stay in him bags. Traffickers will often tell their victims to lie if questioned, but our staff are trained to catch any small inconsistencies in their story. In the end the staff person making the interception reported that they felt somewhat sure that it was a trafficking case. Because traffickers try their best to make things look normal it isn't always possible to know for certain that trafficking is taking place. 

Suraj returned home before a full interview could be completed with him, but a staff person from our Kathmandu office will follow up with him by phone in about one month to see how he is doing. Suraj was intercepted as a result of your support. We believe that human trafficking - what may have happened to Suraj without your help - is the greatest injustice in the world. Thank you for your support in helping to prevent Suraj from being trafficked.

INFO|2017-01-27 00:28:11,388|export_import.story_io[123-import_story_row]>> On December 2, 2016 Tiny Hands Nepal staff at Hetauda intercepted a 12 year old boy named Nirmal who was traveling with 37 other people, 27 of which appeared to be victims and 10 of which appeared to be traffickers. Border and transit monitoring staff are trained to observe people's manner, appearance and actions for clues that something may be wrong. In this case the attention of our staff was initially drawn to Nirmal because he was wearing village clothes. A person's attire and the things they are carrying with them can provide telltale hints about them and where they are from.

When he was questioned by our transit staff Nirmal said that he was on his way to India for study. Upon further investigation our staff recognized several red flags, including that although Nirmal said he was going to study at a school he didn't know the school's name and location. Traffickers will sometimes use the promise of a good education to entice their victims to come with them, and not knowing where they are going is a strong indicator that this is what is happening. In the end the staff person making the interception reported that they felt somewhat sure that it was a trafficking case. Because traffickers try their best to make things look normal it isn't always possible to know for certain that trafficking is taking place. 

 Nirmal was intercepted as a result of your support. We believe that human trafficking - what may have happened to Nirmal without your help - is the greatest injustice in the world. Thank you for your support in helping to prevent Nirmal from being trafficked.

INFO|2017-01-27 00:28:12,323|export_import.story_io[123-import_story_row]>> On December 2, 2016 Tiny Hands Nepal staff at Hetauda intercepted an 11 year old boy named Bishal who was traveling with 37 other people, 27 of which appeared to be victims and 10 of which appeared to be traffickers. Border and transit monitoring staff are trained to observe people's manner, appearance and actions for clues that something may be wrong. In this case the attention of our staff was initially drawn to Bishal because he was wearing village clothes. A person's attire and the things they are carrying with them can provide telltale hints about them and where they are from.

When he was questioned by our transit staff Bishal said that he was on his way to India for study. Upon further investigation our staff recognized several red flags, including that although Bishal said he was going to study at a school he didn't know the school's name and location. Traffickers will sometimes use the promise of a good education to entice their victims to come with them, and not knowing where they are going is a strong indicator that this is what is happening. In the end the staff person making the interception reported that they felt somewhat sure that it was a trafficking case. Because traffickers try their best to make things look normal it isn't always possible to know for certain that trafficking is taking place. 

 Bishal was intercepted as a result of your support. We believe that human trafficking - what may have happened to Bishal without your help - is the greatest injustice in the world. Thank you for your support in helping to prevent Bishal from being trafficked.

INFO|2017-01-27 00:29:36,190|export_import.story_io[123-import_story_row]>> On December 14, 2016 Tiny Hands Nepal staff at Tikapur intercepted a 19 year old woman named Rupa who was traveling with 2 other people who appeared to be victims. Border and transit monitoring staff are trained to observe people's manner, appearance and actions for clues that something may be wrong. In this case the attention of our staff was initially drawn to Rupa because she appeared nervous or afraid. The manner in which a person is behaving can raise suspicion and is one of the main things to which our staff pay attention.

When she was questioned by our border staff Rupa said that she was on her way to India for a job. Upon further investigation our staff recognized several red flags, including that Rupa was running away from home. Although this may not necessarily mean that she was being trafficked, it does mean that she was significantly more vulnerable and at a high risk of being trafficked or exploited. In the end the staff person making the interception reported that they were unsure whether trafficking was taking place, but still suspected it. By stopping possible victims before they are exploited it is often impossible to know for sure if they were being trafficked, but in this case it was clearly a real risk. 

Rupa returned home before a full interview could be completed with her, but a staff person from our Kathmandu office will follow up with her by phone in about one month to see how she is doing. Rupa was intercepted as a result of your support. We believe that human trafficking - what may have happened to Rupa without your help - is the greatest injustice in the world. Thank you for your support in helping to prevent Rupa from being trafficked.
