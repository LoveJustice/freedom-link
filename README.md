# Story
Tiny Hands has donors that are being sent emails about stories from the interceptions that are saved on the Dream Suite (IRFs). Each month these donors are being sent a story that is currently being generated by Jon Hudlow's excel sheet. The excel sheet converts data from an interception into a story based on a complex equation, the text of which is being used to create an Adobe Spark page that is then sent to donors. These stories can be prioritized based on the red flags included in the interception, which will be used to ensure donors receive a variety of stories. Before sending an email, we should allow a user at the Tiny Hands home base to check the stories and make a mark in a column to approve that the story is ready to be sent. Because stories are being sent using Adobe Spark, we will need to create a comparable PDF with the stories placed over the pictures that are currently being used.
