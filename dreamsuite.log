INFO|2017-01-21 09:41:49,206|export_import.test_io[7-import_story_row]>> fullstory:On December 30, 2016 Tiny Hands Nepal staff at Bhadrapur intercepted a 19 year old woman named Sapana who was traveling by herself. Border and transit monitoring staff are trained to observe people's manner, appearance and actions for clues that something may be wrong. In this case the attention of our staff was initially drawn to Sapana because she appeared nervous or afraid. The manner in which a person is behaving can raise suspicion and is one of the main things to which our staff pay attention.

When she was questioned by our border staff Sapana said that she was on her way to India for medical treatment. Upon further investigation our staff recognized several red flags, including that although Sapana said she was going for medical treatment she did not have any medical documents to validate her story. Although it may still have been legitimate, this is also one of the lies traffickers sometimes instruct their victims to tell in order to avoid further scrutiny. In the end the staff person making the interception reported that they felt somewhat sure that it was a trafficking case. Because traffickers try their best to make things look normal it isn't always possible to know for certain that trafficking is taking place. 

Sapana returned home before a full interview could be completed with her, but a staff person from our Kathmandu office will follow up with her by phone in about one month to see how she is doing. Sapana was intercepted as a result of your support. We believe that human trafficking - what may have happened to Sapana without your help - is the greatest injustice in the world. Thank you for your support in helping to prevent Sapana from being trafficked.
